# Basic ecommerce apps
Project developed while taking the **Angular fundamentals from scratch and unit testing** course from **Udemy**

# How to run the project ? 
1. Run npm install after cloning the repository folder, this will generate the node_modules folder. 
2. On **booksECommerceApp** folder from the terminal run **np start**, this will execute the ng serve script and start building and compiling the application. 
3. Once the npm start script finished open on your browser the url where the application it's live. Usually it's http://localhost:4200/ , but this can change if the  4200 port was already being used.
